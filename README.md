In this notebook, I have tried to solve the breast cancer classification problem using the three popular machine learning classifiers : KNN, Logistic Regression,SVM.
After data preprocessing and normalization,we have also used PCA for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
Finally, we employ GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning for each model to obtain the best performance on test data.
